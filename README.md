## Project Description

The Office of Disability Employment Policy of the Department of Labor (DOL) is building out an [NLP algorithm](https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/ableist-language-detector) that analyzes job posts to understand how accessible they are to people with disabilitiesâ€”checking whether text skews towards abilities instead of skills. This in an accessibility toolkit or checklist for employers to create awareness and actionable insights to ensure companies are being inclusive to people with disabilities. This project is be part of the Combating AI Bias Toolkit. 

[Harvard T4SG](https://socialgood.hcs.harvard.edu/) is tasked to develop a website wrapper so that users can copy/paste text into the browser which would then call the model that the DOL is building and would pass back the results that the model finds. The contributors for this projects are:
- Jamie Lu [Github](https://github.com/lujamie)
- Zad Chin [Github](https://github.com/Iwanttobeatuna)
- Kevin Tan [Github](https://github.com/kevintan250)

- `git clone https://github.com/lujamie/dol-web.git`
Create virtual environemnt: 
- `python3 -m venv [name of virtual environment]`
- `. [virtualenv]/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python -m space download en_core_web_sm`
- `git clone https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/ableist-language-detector.git`
- `cd ableist-language-detector`
- `pip install -e .`
The detector module should be installed now! To check you can change back to the `dol-web` directory and run the following in a python prompt:
>>> `import ableist_language_detector`
>>> `ableist_language_detector.__version__`
Output: `'0.1.0'`

Running on Docker instead of `virtualenv`:
- Directory: `dol-web`
- Docker: `docker compose -f compose-django.yml up --build`

## About Ableist Language

**What is ableist language?**

> Ableist language is language that is offensive to people with disability. It can also refer to language that is derogatory, abusive or negative about disability. Ableism is the systemic exclusion and oppression of people with disability, often expressed and reinforced through language. [[source]](https://pwd.org.au/resources/disability-info/language-guide/ableist-language/)

**Why is this tool important?**

Ableist language in job descriptions can cause people with disabilities to feel excluded from jobs that they are qualified for. This typically occurs when a description references [*abilities*](https://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/browse/Abilities/) or enduring attributes of an individual that are unnecessary for the job or for which [accommodations](https://askjan.org/) can be proactively offered instead of focusing on developed [*skills*](https://www.onetonline.org/skills/) that can be acquired to succeed in the role. By identifying ableist language and suggesting alternatives, this tool will support more inclusive hiring practices.
