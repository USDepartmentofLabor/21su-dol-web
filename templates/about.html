                    The <a href = "https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep" target = "_blank" >Office of Disability Employment Policy</a> of the <a href = "https://www.dol.gov/" target = "_blank">Department of Labor (DOL)</a> built an NLP algorithm that analyzes job posts to understand how accessible they are to people with disabilitiesâ€”checking whether text skews towards abilities instead of skills. 
					This in an accessibility toolkit or checklist for employers to create awareness and actionable insights to ensure companies are being inclusive to people with disabilities.

								What is ableist language?
							</h3>
							<div class="usa-summary-box__text">
								<p style = "line-height: 2rem;">Ableist language is language that is offensive to people with disability.

					<h2 style="padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">Why is this tool important?</h2>
			
					<p style = "line-height: 2rem; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 2rem;">
                    	Ableist language in job descriptions can cause people with disabilities to feel excluded from jobs that they are qualified for. This typically occurs when a description references <a href = "https://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/browse/Abilities/" target="="_blank><i>abilities</i></a> or enduring attributes of an individual 
						that are unnecessary for the job or for which <a href = "https://askjan.org/" ><i>accommodations</i></a> 
						can be proactively offered instead of focusing on developed 
						<a href = "https://www.onetonline.org/skills/" ><i>skills</i></a> that can be acquired to succeed 
						in the role. By identifying ableist language and suggesting alternatives, 
						this tool will support more inclusive hiring practices.
