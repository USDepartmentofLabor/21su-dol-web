			<h4>How to use this tool</h4>
			<p>
				Ableist language is language that is offensive to people with disability. 
				This type of language in job descriptions can cause people with disabilities to feel excluded from jobs that they are qualified for. 
				This tool checks job descriptions for ableist language and suggests alternative phrasing that supports more fair and inclusive hiring.
